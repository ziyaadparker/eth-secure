# Ethereum Security Database

Code to generate all possible ethereum private keys
Used the api from [PyEthereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum) to get the corresponding public keys

n_skip = setting the number of times it skips.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziyaadparker/eth-secure/
cd eth-secure
python generate.py
```

You will now get a csv file with private and public ethereum keys.
